Collection of low-level HTTP and FTP file transfer tools

FTP
---
An old and battle hardend FTP client library, works with many
old and cranky FTP servers that the standard .Net libraries can't handle.

Todo:
* Integrate into the rest of the system.

HTTP
----
An experimental HTTP / WebDAV file transfer tool, partly to work around 
bugs in 2.x versions of Mono, partly just for kicks.

Todo:
* Get->Put direct streaming
* Digest authentication
* chunked upload & download
